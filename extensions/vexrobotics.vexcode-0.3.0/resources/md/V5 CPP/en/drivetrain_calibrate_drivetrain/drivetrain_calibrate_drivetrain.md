# Drivetrain Calibrate

Calibrates the Drivetrain.

```cpp
calibrateDrivetrain();
```

## How To Use

The `calibrateDrivetrain();` command will calibrate the Drivetrain. The Drivetrain must remain stationary during the calibration process.

The `calibrateDrivetrain();` command will cause your program to wait until the calibration process is done.

```cpp
calibrateDrivetrain();
```
